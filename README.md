## What was the Challenge?
Build an amazing portfolio website!

This is good practice to work with not having complete information from the client and making decisions on your own based on “creative direction”. The rest is up to you to research and figure out. Use this as a challenge to learn how to work with project requirements from a client, or go off on your own and create your dream portfolio website. Just make sure you share it with the community. You can see the project requirements of the client here: 

1a) Visual Aesthetic = http://edwindejongh.co/

1b) Navigation and Flow = http://admirhadzic.com

BUT, a requirement is that there still must be a wall of projects similar to this: http://yimaiguan.com/index.php or http://dccper.com/work/all

“Nav and Flow” shows “recent/highlighted” works, but a wall for all projects should still be present/visible beneath.

2) Content and Images:

https://medium.com/@tosfan4ever/my-current-product-design-portfolio-90d62377473

But also have the following navigation options or sections up top or made visible:

These 2 can be in the same webpage or at least under the same tab called “Side-Hustles"
- UXelerate - have another “coming soon” page with the following brief description: “a fellowship program for intermediate-level product designers looking to make social impact.”
- Silly Valley: have a “coming soon” page with the following brief description: “a multimedia project that’s all about satirizing the worlds of entrepreneurship and entertainment”.

- Not entirely sure, up to the creativity of the students but I’m also going to be an instructor at the Blockchain Hub. I’m not sure if this should fall under “Presentations” or “Side-Hustles” since it’s both. I’ll be an instructor of the Certified Blockchain UX Designer course here - theblockchainhub.com/academy. I’m also an instructor on Sklllshare for an online digital product design course (that I need to re-upload higher quality videos for) - https://medium.muz.li/ui-ux-case-study-charity-app-payment-flow-6000e735d2e9

- Design Process: (AN: You dont need to recreate these pages exactly... just have spave available for them so the client can add them later) this will lead to an interactive page that’ll take inspiration from this: http://tianyuanzhao.me/images/Design%20Process.png Also give space for “tools I use” such as this - https://www.alexanderseegers.com/process/

- Writings: embedded blog that takes my medium articles and makes it viewable in the site. Is this possible? Like does Medium have an API that allows for this? Or maybe it’ll just link to my Medium. But really, I’d like it to be within the site.

These 2 can be in the same webpage called “Presentations” or something, divided in two like a slash down the middle dividing them left and right:
- Speaking Engagements: a list and links to talks I’ve/I’ll give
- Performances: similarly, a list and links to talks I’ve/I’ll give'

General Content:

- Description of myself:
"I love product design, blockchain, and social innovation aspiring to become a digital engineer - someone who lies at the cross-section of data, design, and development. I'm a lifelong learner, passionate about exponential-thinking, design-thinking, and systems-thinking. I am what you may call an "innovation-thinker". I'm also a writer, singer, pianist - artist and performer overall; a comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate. At the end of the day I'm young, scrappy, and hungry makin' it in the big city of the 6ix.”

- Contact Us similar to this - http://www.creative-portfolios.com/portfolio_page/ at the very bottom (AN: Just have something using mailchimp here)

- Tagline: I make heavenly UX come alive thus enabling greater wealth for U & I.
